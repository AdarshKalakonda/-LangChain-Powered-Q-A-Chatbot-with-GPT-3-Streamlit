# 🧠 LangChain Q&A Chatbot  

A **Q&A chatbot** built using **LangChain**, **OpenAI's GPT-3**, and **Streamlit**, allowing users to ask questions and receive AI-generated responses in real-time.  

## 📌 What is this project?  
This chatbot is a simple yet effective **Question & Answer (Q&A) system** that uses **OpenAI's GPT-3 (text-davinci-003)** model via LangChain. It provides intelligent responses based on user input. The **Streamlit** interface makes it interactive and easy to use.  

## 🔍 How Does It Work?  
1. **User Input**: The user enters a question in the Streamlit text box.  
2. **Processing the Query**:  
   - The input is sent to OpenAI’s **GPT-3 model** using **LangChain**.  
   - A temperature setting (`0.5`) balances creativity and relevance.  
3. **Generating a Response**:  
   - OpenAI’s model generates a **context-aware** response.  
   - The response is returned and displayed in the **Streamlit app**.  
4. **User Interaction**:  
   - The user can continue asking questions and receive AI-generated answers.
